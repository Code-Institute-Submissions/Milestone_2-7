# Against the Odds: Women Trailblazers in Statistics #

With my daughters & every other girl in mind, I started planning an online memory game for my coding course, on Women Trailblazers in Statistics. 
Aim is to match portraits of 8 statisticians in pairs against the clock 

Color composition was inspired by this picture of Margaret Martin (left) and Helen Walker in 1980 - what outfits!
