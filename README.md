# Against the Odds: Women Trailblazers in Statistics #


## 1. Overview ##

This memory was planned and coded with my daughters and every other girl (and boy!) in mind. Statistical sciences, like many other disciplines in Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) are still very much male dominated and I wanted show that success and great performances are possible for women by designing this game around eight
women who were trailblazers and outstanding contributors to Statistics. All of them succeeded at a time when the profession was even more unfavourable for female - or indeed any other - than it 
is today. They all blazed the way despite the considerable odds against them - hence my title.

It has been created for entertainment and educational purposes for all ages from 8 onwards. Using images from ...the game allows players to match two cards of the same character 
image in pairs before the timer reaches zero. 

Color composition was inspired by this picture of Margaret Martin (left) and Helen Walker in 1980 - what outfits!

*Wireframes*

I used Balsamiq to create three wireframes, for desktop, tablet, and mobile:



![Balsamiq wireframe](assets/wireframes/trailblazers_desktop.png)
![Balsamiq wireframes](assets/wireframes/trailblazers_tablet.png)
![Balsamiq wireframes](assets/wireframes/trailblazers_mobile.png)


As can be seen, the 'game over' overlay was added for the desktop view; the 'click to start' as well as the 'victory' and 'prize' overlays were sketched out as a comment in the original Balsamiq 
wireframe. The prize page (prize.html) was added after I realized that a portrait gallery of all eight protagonists would be 
more informative and appealing to the user than a 'prize' overlay with a link to just one or two statisticians.

## 4. Technologies Used

* The wireframes for this project were drawn up with [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)

* The Syne mono font is drawn from [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/).

* The Favicons have been created with [Favicon](https://favicon.io/).

Cursor

* ...was inspired by code from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)    

* Code for shadows behind portrait images on prize.html is taken from [Codepen](https://codepen.io/)

*  [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) were used to host the software development versions and to create and save the code respectively.

* [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) built directly into the Google Chrome browser were used constantly thoughout the development cycle to test responsive design 
and diagnose problems.

* I used [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) for both HTML and CSS to run my code looking for errors.

* [Jshint](https://jshint.com/) to validate my JavaScript code 

* [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) to test the performance of the website.

* [AmiResponsiveDesign](.http://ami.responsivedesign.is) to test responsive design on various devices.

* Portrait images were sourced from wikipedia.

* Bell curve on back of the cards was purchased from [TheNounProject](https://thenounproject.com/).

* All sounds were acquired from this [repository](http://dight310.byu.edu/media/audio/FreeLoops.com/2/) and from [freesound](https://freesound.org/home/).

## 7. Credits

### 7.1. Content

All text for this project was written by the developer.

### 7.2. Media

### 7.3. Ackowledgments

Memory game tutorials on the web, especially by [WebDevSimplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) 
and [PortEXE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) were a tremendous help. PortEXE does a great job explaining the Fisher-Yates algorithm, for instance, as well as a number of 
other  

I was further inspired by Sandra [Israel-Ovirih's](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-build-a-memory-matching-game-in-javascript) and Marina [Ferreira's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZniVgo8U7ek&t=681s) 
tutorials which provided helpful explanations.

Page redirect between index.html and prize.html in JS was taken from [tutorialrepublic](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/how-to-redirect-to-another-web-page-using-jquery.php) and edited to suit my needs.


Centering the mute and play buttons horizontally and vertically is inspired by [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_center_button.asp), whilst the JS for both buttons to function
properly was inspired by Adam Khoury's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsSXzdn_0Gg) and edited to fit my code.



A special thank to my mentor [Adegbenga Adeye](https://github.com/deye9) for commenting on earlier versions of my code and especially for going through some tricky JS issues with me.

The idea for active card on click is from Marina [Ferreira](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZniVgo8U7ek&t=681s) (from 11:33min)
